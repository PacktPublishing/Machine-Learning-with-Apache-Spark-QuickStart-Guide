Overview of Open Images V4
Open Images is a dataset of ~9 million images that have been annotated with image-level labels and object bounding boxes.
The training set of V4 contains 14.6M bounding boxes for 600 object classes on 1.74M images, making it the largest existing dataset with object location annotations. The boxes have been largely manually drawn by professional annotators to ensure accuracy and consistency. The images are very diverse and often contain complex scenes with several objects (8.4 per image on average). Moreover, the dataset is annotated with image-level labels spanning thousands of classes.
