The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)

What is TCIA?
TCIA is a service which de-identifies and hosts a large archive of medical images of cancer accessible for public download. The data are organized as “Collections”, typically patients related by a common disease (e.g. lung cancer), image modality (MRI, CT, etc) or research focus. DICOM is the primary file format used by TCIA for image storage. Supporting data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics, pathology, and expert analyses are also provided when available.

New Collection proposals (primary data) are reviewed by the TCIA Advisory Group. If approved, the Data Collection Center (DCC) provides hands-on support to image providers to de-identify and curate their data. After the data has been processed it is made available in four different ways for users to access:

Collection summary pages can be accessed from the home page which provide a detailed explanation of each data set as well as direct download links to quickly obtain all images and supporting data for a given Collection.
The Data Portal provides more advanced searching, browsing and filtering capabilities to select image subsets or download images from multiple Collections which meet search criteria.
The Programmatic Interface (REST API) allows software developers to build access to TCIA data into their scripts and applications.
TCIA also encourages the creation of Data Analysis Centers (DACs) which provide additional capabilities for visualizing or analyzing TCIA data by connecting to our TCIA Programmatic Interface (REST API) or by mirroring our Collections.
To enhance the value of TCIA’s primary data collections we also encourage the research community to publish their analysis results. Potential analyses could include tumor segmentations, radiomics features, derived/reprocessed images, and radiologist assessments.  You can view the analyses published by other TCIA users in our Analysis Results directory.

Data Usage Policies and Restrictions

Data Usage Policy
Most collections are freely available to browse, download, and use for commercial, scientific and educational purposes as outlined in the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.  Please consult the Citation & Data Usage Policy for each Collection you've used to see usage restrictions. Some collections have additional copyrights or restrictions associated with their use which we have summarized at the end of this page for convenience.  

Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) Publication Guidelines
CPTAC data sets consist of a wide variety of data types including proteomics, genomics, and clinical in addition to radiology and pathology imaging.  If you utilize CPTAC data which was obtained outside of TCIA you must adhere to their data use agreement outlined at https://proteomics.cancer.gov/data-portal/about/data-use-agreement.  If all of the data used in your analyses was obtained directly from TCIA you need only follow TCIA's Data Usage Policies and Restrictions.
